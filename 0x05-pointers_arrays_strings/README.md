# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Tasks

* **0. 98 Battery st.**
  * [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c): C function that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
  * `Compiled using:`  gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 tests/0-main.c 0-reset_to_98.c -o 0-98

* **1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
  * [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c): C function that swaps the value of two integers.
  * `Compiled using:` gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 tests/1-main.c 1-swap.c -o 1-swap

* **2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**
  * [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c): C function that returns the length of a string.
  * `Compiled using:` gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 tests/2-main.c 2-strlen.c -o 2-strlen

* **3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**
  * [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c): C function that prints a string, followed by a new line to `stdout`.
  * `Compiled using:` gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c tests/3-main.c 3-puts.c -o 3-puts

* **4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**
  * [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c): C function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
  * `Compiled using:` gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c tests/4-main.c 4-print_rev.c -o 4-print_rev

* **5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes**
  * [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c): C function that reverses a string.
  * `Compiled using:` gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 tests/5-main.c 5-rev_string.c -o 5-rev_string

* **6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**
  * [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c): C function that prints every other character of a string followed by a new line.
  * `Compiled using:` 

* **7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**
  * [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c): C function that prints the second half of a string followed by a new line.
  * `Compiled using:` 

* **8. Arrays are not pointers**
  * [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c): C function that prints an input `n` elements
  of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
    * Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
    * Numbers are displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array.
    * `Compiled using:` 

* **9. strcpy**
  * [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c): C function that copies the string pointed to by
  `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
    * Returns the pointer to `dest`.
    * `Compiled using:` 

* **10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers**
  * [100-atoi.c](./100-atoi.c): C function that converts a string to an integer
  without using `long`, new variable arrays, or hard-coded special values, as follows:
    * The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters.
    * Takes into account all `+` and `-` signs before the number.
    * If there are no numbers in the string, the function returns `0`.
    * `Compiled using:` 

* **11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code**
  * [101-keygen.c](./101-keygen.c): C program that generates random valid passwords
  for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x04.c).
  * `Compiled using:`
