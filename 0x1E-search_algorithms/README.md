0x1E-search_algorithms

## Learning Objectives
 - What is a search algorithm [DEF: In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.]
 - What is a linear search
 - What is a binary search
 - What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs


# Tasks
- **0. Linear search**  
  - Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
    - Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
    - Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
    - size is the number of elements in array and value is the value to search for
    - Your function must return the first index where value is located
    - If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
    - Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)

- 1. **Binary search**
  - Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
    - Prototype : int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
    - Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in 
    - size is the number of elements in array and value is the value to search for
    - Your function must return the index where value is located
    - You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
    - You can assume that value wonâ€™t appear more than once in array
    - If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
    - You must print the array being searched every time it changes.
