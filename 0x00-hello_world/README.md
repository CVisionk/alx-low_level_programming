## Summary

This repository contains a collection of C programs demonstrating various aspects of the language, along with scripts showcasing compilation steps.

C source code execution steps include Preprocessing, Compilation, Assembly, and Linking. C is a compiled language.

## Compilation Steps Scripts

### 0-preprocessor

Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

### 1-compiler

Script that compiles a C file but does not link.

### 2-assembler

Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.

### 3-name

Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

## Programs

### 4-puts.c

Program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the `puts` function.

### 5-printf.c

Program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line using the `printf` function. It compiles without warning using `-Wall` flag.

### 6-size.c

Program that prints the size of various types on a computer it is compiled on.

### 100-intel

Program that generates the assembly code (intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.

### 101-quote.c

Program that prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19 to the standard output.

## Conclusion

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive showcase of C programming concepts. Each program and script serves to highlight different aspects of C programming, from basic syntax to compilation steps and more.
